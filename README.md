# Product-Recommendation-System
This project presents the development and evaluation of a recommendation system for electronic 
products using collaborative filtering techniques, specifically Singular Value Decomposition 
(SVD). The aim of the system is to enhance user experience by providing personalized product 
recommendations based on their historical interactions and ratings.   

The project begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset containing user ratings for 
electronic products. The EDA reveals insights into user-item interactions, rating distributions, 
and dataset characteristics. Preprocessing steps are then applied to clean and structure the data, 
including filtering users and products based on interaction thresholds.   

The main methodology involves constructing an interaction matrix from the processed data, 
where rows represent users, columns represent products, and values represent ratings. This 
matrix serves as the basis for applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to factorize the 
matrix into latent features that capture underlying user preferences and product characteristics.   

Using the factorized matrices from SVD, the recommendation system predicts ratings for 
unrated products and generates top-n product recommendations for users. Evaluation of the 
recommendation system is performed using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) 
to assess the accuracy of predicted ratings compared to actual ratings.   

The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the recommendation system in providing relevant 
and personalized recommendations to users. The system's performance is validated through 
quantitative evaluation metrics, indicating its potential for improving user engagement and 
satisfaction.   

Overall, this project contributes to the field of recommendation systems by showcasing a 
collaborative filtering approach using SVD for electronic product recommendations. Future 
work may explore advanced algorithms, scalability enhancements, and real-time 
recommendation capabilities to further optimize the system's performance and usability.
